# VanArts Student Work
This repository is a collection of my student projects while attending VanArts' 1 year [Web Development and Interactive Design](https://www.vanarts.com/programs/web-development-interactive-design/) program.

Please note that this work is for reference only, and not representative of my current skill-set or production-quality code.

A brief overview of the program and a description of each project follows.

## Overview
The one year program at VanArts is split into 4 terms.

Each of the 4 terms required 1 term project.

Each of the first 3 terms required 2 "Four Eight" projects, which were like intensive practical exams so named because they were scheduled for the 4th and 8th week of each of the first 3 terms. They were assigned on a Thursday afternoon and completed by end of the next day. All of the term projects and "Four Eight" projects required wireframes, mockups, assets, and a completed website based on a fictional client brief.

There were many assignments and smaller projects throughout the program in addition to these major projects.
