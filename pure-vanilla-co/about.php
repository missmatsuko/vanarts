						<li class="question">What is 100% pure vanilla extract?</li>
						<li class="answer">100% pure vanilla extract is produced by soaking real vanilla beans from the Vanilla planifolia plant in alcohol for several months, until the vanilla flavour has been thoroughly extracted into the spirit. Artificial vanilla extract is produced from Vanillin, the chemical compound which gives vanilla its aroma. Vanillin can be sourced naturally, or can be more inexpensively synthesized from clove oil, pine sap and even from wood pulp, a by-product of the paper industry  </li>
